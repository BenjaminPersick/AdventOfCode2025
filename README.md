# Advent of Code 2025

## Overview

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a programming-puzzle advent calendar. More detailed
information about Advent of Code may be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about). This repository
consists of the code I have written to solve this year's puzzles, and the text files containing the
inputs for each day that I have worked on so far.
